# Improving Retrieval System in RAG Architecture to Expand LLM Context

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to improve the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). RAG combines a **retrieval** process (selecting relevant content from a database) and **generation** (producing context-aware answers using an LLM). Our goal is to refine the **retrieval component**, optimizing the context provided to the LLM and thus elevating the response quality.

### Project Stakeholder

The primary stakeholder is **LINKS Foundation**, which seeks to leverage advanced RAG systems for European projects and other applications.

## Objectives

1. Enhance the **retrieval process** by incorporating advanced chunk processing, including:
   - Summarization
   - Topic extraction
   - Key entity identification
2. Optimize **query expansion** to:
   - Identify relevant topics and entities
   - Differentiate instructions from user queries
   - Handle multiple questions effectively

## Data
<!---
We use the **MS MARCO dataset (Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension)**, a large-scale, open-source dataset for passage ranking and question answering. The dataset includes:
- **Triplets**: Query, passage, relevance score
- Tasks:
  - **Passage Retrieval**: Evaluate retrieval quality
  - **Question Answering**: Derive answers using passages

We use the MS MARCO dataset (Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension) and TriviaQA, two large-scale, open-source datasets for passage ranking and question answering. The datasets include:

- **MS MARCO**:
Triplets: Query, passage, relevance score  

  Tasks:
   - Passage Retrieval: Evaluate retrieval quality
   - Question Answering: Derive answers using passages
    
- **TriviaQA**:  
A challenging dataset that contains question-answer pairs with supporting evidence sourced from Wikipedia and web documents.  

  Tasks:
   - Question Answering: Use retrieved passages to find precise answers.

## Workflow

### Project Phases
1. **Design and Management**:
   - Understand project requirements
   - Develop initial designs
   - Create presentations and engage with the mentor
2. **Development**:
   - Research resources
   - Build baseline models
   - Incorporate advanced retrieval techniques
3. **Dry Run**:
   - Restructure the database
   - Experiment with ideas
   - Produce an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
4. **Final Presentation and Evaluation**:
   - Compile findings
   - Develop the final product
   - Deliver project presentations and take exams

### Tools and Techniques
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and summarization
- **Scoring mechanisms** to improve retrieval accuracy
